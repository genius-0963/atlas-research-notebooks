# Contributing to Atlas Research Notebooks

 This collection showcases the capabilities of the [atlas-research.io](https://atlas-research.io) platform through practical examples and research implementations.

## How to Contribute

### Types of Contributions

We welcome several types of contributions:

1. **New Research Notebooks**: Original analysis, tutorials, or academic paper reproductions
2. **Improvements to Existing Code**: Bug fixes, optimizations, or enhanced documentation
3. **New Research Areas**: Adding examples in new domains (finance, biology, ML, etc.)
4. **Documentation**: Improving README files, adding comments, or creating tutorials
5. **Platform Feature Demonstrations**: Showcasing specific atlas-research.io capabilities

### Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/atlas-research-notebooks.git
   cd atlas-research-notebooks
   ```

2. **Create a Feature Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-contribution-name
   ```

3. **Set Up Development Environment**
   - Ensure you have Python 3.11+ installed
   - Install Jupyter: `pip install jupyter`
   - Dependencies are managed per notebook via pip install cells

## Contribution Guidelines

### Notebook Standards

#### Naming Convention
- Use descriptive, numbered names: `001_descriptive_name.ipynb`
- Include corresponding Python script: `001_descriptive_name.py`
- Place in appropriate domain folder: `crypto/`, `finance/`, `machine-learning/`

#### Notebook Structure
Each notebook should include:

1. **Title Cell** (Markdown)
   - Clear title describing the analysis
   - Brief description of the research objective

2. **Dependencies Cell** (Code)
   ```python
   !pip install package1 package2 package3
   ```

3. **Imports and Setup** (Code)
   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   import numpy as np
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   # Set visualization theme if applicable
   plt.style.use('dark_background')
   ```

4. **Main Analysis** (Mixed Cells)
   - Well-documented code with markdown explanations
   - Clear variable names and function definitions
   - Intermediate results and visualizations

5. **Results and Conclusions** (Markdown)
   - Summary of findings
   - Potential improvements or next steps

#### Code Quality Standards

- **Comments**: Include clear, concise comments explaining complex logic
- **Documentation**: Use docstrings for custom functions
- **Error Handling**: Include appropriate try/catch blocks for external API calls
- **Reproducibility**: Ensure notebooks can be run from top to bottom without errors
- **Performance**: Include timing information for long-running operations

#### Data and APIs

- **External Data**: Prefer public APIs and datasets when possible
- **API Keys**: Never commit API keys or secrets (use environment variables)
- **Data Size**: Keep example datasets reasonably sized for quick execution

### Submission Process

1. **Test Your Contribution**
   - Run notebooks from start to finish
   - Verify all visualizations render correctly
   - Check that external dependencies install properly

2. **Update Documentation**
   - Include brief description of the analysis
   - Update any relevant table of contents

3. **Create a Pull Request**
   - Use a descriptive title
   - Include detailed description of your contribution
   - Reference any related issues
